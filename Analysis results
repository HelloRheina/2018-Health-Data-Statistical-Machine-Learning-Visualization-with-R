* Results from model trainning and visualization

• Both linear regression and logistic regression analyses indicate a 
negative relationship between Health Outcomes Rank and Health 
Factors Rank. Higher Health Factors Rank corresponds to lower Health 
Outcomes Rank, suggesting that counties with better health factors tend 
to have better health outcomes. This relationship is consistent across 
different modeling approaches, showing the correct prediction. 
• The models, particularly KNN, show varying performance across health 
outcome quartiles. While Quartile 1 predictions are most accurate, 
Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 present challenges, indicating limitations in 
predicting health outcomes solely based on health factors.  
• Decision tree analysis reveals clear thresholds in the Health Factors 
Rank that separate counties into different Health Outcomes Quartiles. 
Similarly, K-means and hierarchical clustering identify distinct clusters 
based on Health Outcomes and Factors Rank. These methods give 
analysis into underlying patterns and groupings within the data, enabling 
a deeper understanding of county-level health disparities and similarities. 
• The hierarchical clustering analysis reveals the presence of distinct 
clusters within the dataset. By visualizing the dendrogram, we can 
observe the grouping of counties based on similarities in health 
outcomes and factors.
